# Resolution of the Debate

The debate remained unresolved until the mid-1920s, when Edwin Hubble provided conclusive evidence using the 100-inch Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory. Hubble observed Cepheid variable stars in the Andromeda Nebula (now known as the Andromeda Galaxy) and measured their distances. His findings showed that the Andromeda Nebula was far outside the Milky Way, confirming that spiral nebulae were indeed separate galaxies.

Henrietta Leavitt's work was pivotal in resolving the debate. Leavitt studied Cepheid variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud and discovered a relationship between their luminosity and their period of variability. This period-luminosity relationship, known as Leavitt's Law, allowed astronomers to determine the absolute luminosity of Cepheids based on their variability period. By comparing this absolute luminosity to the observed brightness, astronomers could calculate the distance to these stars.

## How Cepheid Variables Were Used

Cepheid variable stars are a type of star that pulsates radially, varying in both diameter and temperature, which produces changes in brightness with a well-defined stable period. This period-luminosity relationship is a crucial tool in astronomy for measuring distances to celestial objects.

1. **Observation**: Astronomers observe the period of brightness variations in a Cepheid variable star.
2. **Period-Luminosity Relationship**: Using Leavitt's Law, they determine the star's absolute luminosity based on its period.
3. **Distance Calculation**: By comparing the absolute luminosity to the observed brightness, they calculate the distance to the star.

Edwin Hubble applied this method to Cepheid variable stars in the Andromeda Nebula. By determining their distances, Hubble showed that they were far beyond the boundaries of the Milky Way, thus proving that the Andromeda Nebula, and by extension other spiral nebulae, were separate galaxies.

Henrietta Leavitt's work on Cepheid variable stars led to the formulation of the period-luminosity relationship, which is a key tool in measuring astronomical distances. The formulae involved are essential for understanding how the luminosity (and thus the distance) of Cepheid variables can be determined from their period of variability. 

### Leavitt's Law (Period-Luminosity Relationship)

The period-luminosity relationship states that the logarithm of the period of a Cepheid variable star is directly proportional to its absolute magnitude (intrinsic brightness). Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

$$ M = a \cdot \log_{10}(P) + b $$

where:
- $ M $ is the absolute magnitude of the Cepheid variable star.
- $ P $ is the period of the Cepheid's brightness variation (in days).
- $ a $ and $ b $ are constants that are determined empirically from observations of Cepheids with known distances.

By applying these formulae, astronomers can determine the distances to Cepheid variable stars and, by extension, to the galaxies in which they reside, allowing for a better understanding of the scale of the universe.

````{dropdown} How would the distribution and apparent motion of spiral nebulae influence your interpretation of their nature?
The distribution and motion of spiral nebulae could suggest whether they are part of the Milky Way or not. If they are uniformly distributed across the sky and show a range of motions inconsistent with the Milky Way's rotation, this would support the idea that they are separate galaxies. Conversely, if they were concentrated in a particular region and moved in a way that matched the Milky Way's structure, this would suggest they were part of our galaxy.

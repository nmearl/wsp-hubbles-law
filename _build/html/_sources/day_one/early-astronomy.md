# Early Astronomy

In the early 1900s, astronomy was a field steeped in tradition, with many of its foundational ideas rooted in ancient philosophy. The prevailing view of the universe was one of stability and permanence. Astronomers and scientists, including even the renowned Albert Einstein, adhered to a picture of the cosmos that was largely static and unchanging. This perspective was influenced by centuries of philosophical and scientific thought, extending back to Aristotle.

The Andromeda nebula, photographed at the Yerkes Observatory around 1900. To modern eyes, this object is clearly a galaxy. At the time, though, it was described as "a mass of glowing gas," its true identity unknown. (From the book Astronomy of To-Day, 1909)

## Early 20th-Century Beliefs

As the 20th century dawned, this Aristotelian notion of a static universe persisted. Astronomers of the time, including influential figures like Albert Einstein, generally held to the idea that the universe was unchanging. This belief was rooted in several key factors:

1. **Newtonian Mechanics**: The success of Newton's laws of motion and gravitation provided a framework that suggested a stable and predictable universe. Newtonian mechanics implied that if the universe was in equilibrium, it should remain so unless acted upon by external forces.

2. **Limited Observational Data**: Observational tools and techniques of the time were insufficient to reveal significant changes or dynamic processes on cosmic scales. The lack of evidence for observable changes in the positions and movements of celestial bodies reinforced the belief in a static cosmos.

3. **Einstein's Static Model**: Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of General Relativity in 1915, initially resisted the idea of an expanding or contracting universe. In his original formulation of General Relativity, he introduced a "cosmological constant" to maintain a static universe, counteracting the effects of gravitational attraction. This was a reflection of the prevailing view of an unchanging, eternal universe.

## Transition to a Dynamic Universe

It wasn't until the discovery of the expanding universe by Edwin Hubble in the late 1920s that this static view was challenged. Hubble's observations of distant galaxies showed that the universe was expanding, a finding that necessitated a fundamental shift in our understanding of cosmology. Einstein himself eventually accepted this new perspective, acknowledging the implications of an expanding universe for our understanding of the cosmos.

## Explore the Cosmic Sky

The frame below provides an interactive view of the night sky, using images from real observations.

The brighter band you see going diagonally across the frame (before you try the controls) is caused by stars and dust in our home galaxy, called the Milky Way.

You can explore this view and see what is in the night sky, as astronomers have been doing for centuries. Pan (click and drag) and zoom (scroll in and out) to see parts of the sky beyond this view.

# Selecting Galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

## Introduction to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is one of the most comprehensive astronomical surveys ever conducted. Launched in 2000, the SDSS has mapped a large portion of the sky and collected a wealth of data on millions of celestial objects. Its primary goal is to create detailed and extensive maps of the universe, capturing information on the positions, colors, and spectra of stars, galaxies, and quasars.

The SDSS is incredibly useful for a range of astronomical research. It provides high-quality imaging and spectroscopic data that allows scientists to study the structure and evolution of galaxies, the distribution of dark matter, and the nature of cosmic phenomena. The survey's data set is continually updated, providing a dynamic and rich resource for exploring the universe.

## Selecting Galaxies for Analysis

To get hands-on experience with this data, you'll start by exploring the SDSS SkyServer. The SkyServer Navigator is a powerful tool that allows you to access and visualize the SDSS data. You can find it at [this link](https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr18/VisualTools/navi). 

You will use the SkyServer Navigator to explore the SDSS data and select a set of 10 galaxies for further analysis. Begin by familiarizing yourself with the interface and tools available. Once you've selected your 10 galaxies, you will be able to analyze their properties and perform measurements such as determining their distances.

### Primer on Galaxy Selection

1. After you've open the SDSS Navigator, the first step is to ensure the "Objects with spectra" checkbox is marked under the "Drawing Options". This will highlight objects with available spectroscopic data. You should select only those galaxies that show the red box around them, indicating that they have spectra.
2. When selecting an object, its related information will appear in the panel on the right side. Ensure that the object is of type "GALAXY" -- we don't want to accidentally measure stars!
3. Once you've selected a galaxy, open the shared Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mVRovTF8C1UJkQakQG_E9emnpJIRb1rdNx6UPNcm3rs/edit?usp=sharing) and add your name, the SDSS ID, RA, and Dec of the galaxy to the table. This will help you keep track of your selections and provide a reference for your analysis.

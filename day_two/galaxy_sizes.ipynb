    "# Analyzing SDSS Images with Astroquery and Photutils\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) database to retrieve images of selected galaxies and measure their angular sizes. This process involves two main Python libraries: **Astroquery** for retrieving data from the SDSS, and **Photutils** for analyzing the images and measuring the angular sizes of the galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieving SDSS Images with Astroquery\n",
    "\n",
    "**Astroquery** is a Python library designed to simplify the process of querying astronomical databases. It allows you to retrieve data from various astronomical surveys, including SDSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have Astroquery installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   pip install astroquery\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query the SDSS Database**: Using Astroquery, you can search for images of the galaxies you are interested in. You will need to know the coordinates of each galaxy (right ascension and declination). Hereâ€™s how you can query the SDSS for images:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from astroquery.sdss import SDSS\n",
    "   from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord\n",
    "   import astropy.units as u\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Replace these coordinates with the ones for your galaxies\n",
    "   coordinates = SkyCoord(ra='00:00:00', dec='00:00:00', unit=(u.hourangle, u.deg))\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Query SDSS for the image\n",
    "   xid = SDSS.query_region(coordinates, spectro=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This code will retrieve data related to the galaxy's position. Adjust the parameters according to the specific galaxies you are studying.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Download the Image**: Once you have the image coordinates, you can download the image data using Astroquery:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   image_data = SDSS.get_images(matches=xid)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will provide you with the image data that you can then use for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Angular Size with Photutils\n",
    "\n",
    "**Photutils** is a Python package used for detecting and measuring astronomical sources in images. It provides tools to measure the angular size of celestial objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up Photutils**: Ensure you have Photutils installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   pip install photutils\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load the Image**: After downloading the image with Astroquery, load it into Photutils for analysis. The image will typically be in a format that can be loaded with Astropy's `fits` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from astropy.io import fits\n",
    "   from photutils import detect_sources, source_properties\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Load the image\n",
    "   hdul = fits.open('path_to_your_image.fits')\n",
    "   image_data = hdul[0].data\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detect Sources**: Use Photutils to detect the galaxy in the image. The `detect_sources` function can be used to identify the sources in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from photutils import DAOStarFinder\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Define the star finder\n",
    "   daofind = DAOStarFinder(fwhm=3.0, threshold=5.0)\n",
    "   sources = daofind(image_data)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Measure Angular Size**: Measure the angular size of the detected galaxy. Photutils provides several tools to compute properties like the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the galaxy, which are related to its angular size.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from photutils import EllipticalAperture\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Measure the size\n",
    "   for source in sources:\n",
    "       aperture = EllipticalAperture(source['xcentroid'], source['ycentroid'], a=source['a'], b=source['b'])\n",
    "       properties = source_properties(image_data, aperture)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Convert to Angular Size**: The measurements provided by Photutils are in pixel units. To convert these measurements to angular size, use the image's WCS (World Coordinate System) information to convert pixels to degrees:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from astropy.wcs import WCS\n",
    "   \n",
    "   wcs = WCS(hdul[0].header)\n",
    "   pixel_scale = wcs.pixel_scale_matrix.diagonal()  # in degrees per pixel\n",
    "   angular_size = properties['a'] * pixel_scale[0]  # convert to degrees\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve Images**: Use Astroquery to obtain images of the galaxies you selected from the SDSS database. Make sure you have the coordinates of the galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze Images**: Load the images using Photutils and detect the galaxies in each image. Measure their angular sizes by analyzing the detected sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convert Measurements**: Convert the angular size measurements from pixel units to degrees using the image's WCS information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Report Findings**: Compile the angular size measurements for each galaxy and compare them. This will give you insights into the sizes of galaxies as observed in SDSS images.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you will be able to retrieve and analyze images of galaxies from SDSS and measure their angular sizes, gaining hands-on experience with astronomical data analysis tools."

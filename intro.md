Humans have always looked to the sky and wondered how we and our universe came
to be. In this project, you will use authentic astronomical data to investigate
the mysteries of our Universe. In particular, you will be answering these
questions:

When scientists collect data to answer questions no one has answered yet, there
is no answer key in the back of some book. So, as work through this project,
you will learn how to evaluate the reliability of your results. Are the data
really good enough to support a conclusion? How can you know?

Just as scientists constantly must, you'll determine what can be concluded from
the data at-hand, and how much confidence you can have in your conclusions.

# The Expanding Universe

In the late 1920s, Edwin Hubble made a revolutionary discovery that fundamentally altered our understanding of the universe. By analyzing the light from distant galaxies, Hubble found that the universe is expanding. This discovery was based on his observations of the redshifts of light from galaxies and led to the formulation of Hubble's Law, which states that the velocity at which a galaxy is receding from us is proportional to its distance.

As we've learned, a key aspect of Hubble's work was the ability to measure distances to distant galaxies. This involved using Cepheid variable stars, whose pulsation period is directly related to their absolute luminosity through the period-luminosity relation. This method allowed astronomers to accurately gauge distances to galaxies, enabling them to compare these distances to the velocities of the galaxies.

## Redshift and Its Role in Measuring Velocity

To understand the expansion of the universe, it is essential to measure the velocity at which galaxies are moving away from us. This is where the concept of redshift comes into play.

````{admonition} Redshift
:class: important
Redshift occurs when the wavelength of light from a celestial object is stretched, making it appear redder than it would if the object were stationary relative to us. This stretching of light is caused by the Doppler effect, which is the change in frequency (or wavelength) of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the source of the wave.

Similar to sounds from a moving vehicle, as a star moves away from us, the light becomes redder. As it moves towards us, the light becomes bluer. Image via Wikipedia.

**How Redshift is Derived**:
1. **Spectral Analysis**: Astronomers analyze the spectrum of light from distant galaxies. A spectrum is a spread of light into its component colors, each corresponding to a specific wavelength.

2. **Compare with Standard Spectra**: By comparing the observed spectrum with the spectrum of light from the same elements in a laboratory (standard spectrum), astronomers can identify shifts in the absorption or emission lines.

3. **Calculate Redshift (z)**: The redshift $ z $ is calculated using the formula:

   $$ z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}} - \lambda_{\text{emitted}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted}}} $$

   where:
   - $ \lambda_{\text{observed}} $ is the observed wavelength of the light.
   - $ \lambda_{\text{emitted}} $ is the original wavelength of the light emitted by the source.

4. **Velocity Calculation**: The velocity \( v \) at which a galaxy is receding from us can be derived from the redshift using the formula:

   $$ v = z \cdot c $$

   where $ c $ is the speed of light (approximately 299,792 km/s).

## Implications of Hubble’s Discoveries

Hubble’s findings showed that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. This relationship is captured by Hubble’s Law:

$$ v = H_0 \cdot d $$

where:
- $ v $ is the velocity of the galaxy.
- $ H_0 $ is Hubble’s constant.
- $ d $ is the distance to the galaxy.

This groundbreaking discovery led to the understanding that the universe is expanding, providing strong evidence for the Big Bang theory and fundamentally altering our conception of the cosmos.

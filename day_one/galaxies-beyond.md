# Galaxies Beyond Our Milky Way

## The Era of Spiral Nebulae

In the early 20th century, astronomers were fascinated by the mysterious "spiral nebulae" they observed in the night sky. These spiral-shaped objects, visible through powerful telescopes, sparked intense curiosity and debate. At the time, the nature of these nebulae was unclear, and two main hypotheses emerged. One proposed that spiral nebulae were part of our own Milky Way galaxy, while the other suggested that they were separate, distant galaxies.


## The Great Debate: Shapley vs. Curtis

The controversy over the nature of spiral nebulae culminated in a famous public debate held on April 26, 1920, at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Known as the "Great Debate," it featured two prominent astronomers: Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis.

### Harlow Shapley's Argument

Harlow Shapley, based at the Mount Wilson Observatory, argued that the Milky Way was the entirety of the universe and that spiral nebulae were merely part of it. Shapley's conclusions were based on his studies of globular clusters, which he used to estimate the size of the Milky Way. He believed that the Milky Way was vast enough to contain all observed nebulae and that these nebulae were relatively close to us, within our galaxy.

````{dropdown} What are Globular Clusters?
Globular clusters are spherical collections of stars that orbit the center of a galaxy as a satellite. They are densely packed with stars, typically containing hundreds of thousands to millions of stars, and are among the oldest known objects in the universe, with ages often exceeding 10 billion years. These clusters are found in the halo of galaxies, including the Milky Way, and have a distinctive spherical shape with a high concentration of stars near their centers.

Key characteristics of globular clusters include:

- Spherical Shape: Globular clusters have a roughly spherical shape due to their strong gravitational binding.
- Old Age: They consist of very old stars, primarily Population II stars, which are low in heavy elements compared to younger stars.
- High Density: Stars within globular clusters are densely packed, especially towards the core.

### Heber Curtis's Argument

Heber Curtis, from the Lick Observatory, held a different view. Curtis argued that spiral nebulae were indeed separate galaxies, or "island universes," far beyond the bounds of the Milky Way. He cited observations of novae (exploding stars) in spiral nebulae, which appeared much fainter than similar events within the Milky Way, suggesting that these nebulae were at great distances. Curtis also pointed to the high radial velocities of spiral nebulae, indicating they were not gravitationally bound to our galaxy.
